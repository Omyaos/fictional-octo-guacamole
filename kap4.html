    <p> a small breed of dog that do not reach heights of more than 12 inches. <br> like the Basenji do not shed much and only need to be brushed once or twice a week to keep the coat in good condition. <br>These dogs are energetic and they do need to have one to two walks per day, but they are relatively easy to train for walking on a leash. are a good choice for people who have allergies because of the low shedding. They are quiet dogs who don’t usually bark unless they are frightened, terribly excited or need something from you.</p>
